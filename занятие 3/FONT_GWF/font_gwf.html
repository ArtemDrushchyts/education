	<h1>My heart will go on</h1>
<p>Every night in my dreams<br> 
I see you, I feel you.<br>
That is how I know you go on.</p>

<p>Far across the distance<br> 
And spaces between us <br>
You have come to show you go on.</p>

<p class="undersong">Near, far, wherever you are <br>
I believe that the heart does go on <br>
Once more you opened the door<br> 
And you're here in my heart <br>
And my heart will go on and on.</p>

<p>Love can touch us one time <br>
And last for a lifetime<br> 
And never let go till we're gone.</p>

<p>Love was when I loved you<br> 
One true time I hold to <br>
In my life we'll always go on.</p>

<p class="undersong">Near, far, wherever you are<br> 
I believe that the heart does go on <br>
Once more you opened the door<br> 
And you're here in my heart <br>
And my heart will go on and on.</p>
<p>You're here, there's nothing I fear,<br> 
And I know that my heart will go on. <br>
We'll stay forever this way <br>
You are safe in my heart <br>
And my heart will go on and on.</p>
